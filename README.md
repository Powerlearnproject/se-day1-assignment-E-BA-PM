Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain qualified software systems. it is important because it enables the creatton of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
windows, macOS AND ALSO web applictions e.g facebook and google.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements; gathering and documenting also elictating user needs and system requirements
Design; being creative with high-level and concised designs of software user interface
Implementation; writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing; Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment; releasing the software to users or customers
Maintenance; providing onging support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall; a sequential approach with distinct phases,
Agile; iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change. like in phone production agile is best use for their production.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer; Reponsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer; ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager; Oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs); its a Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g Visual Studio and Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS); its a software tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git and subversion.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements; Requirements may change during the development cycle leading to a scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines; Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can results in rushed development and compromised quality
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing;  Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing; Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing; Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing; Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Its important because it measures code reviews, automated testing and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering; is a starting point or a piece of text that is used to generate natural language responses from a language model,its all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from AI assistant.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
I need to create a restaurant where Guests enjoy the pleasant atmosphere and receive excellent service and also appreciate a beautiful view.
